This is an educational project assigned by MIT for my Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN.

# INSTALLATION & HOW TO RUN

# MAPBOX ACCESS TOKEN
You will need to replace YOUR ACCESS TOKEN in the javascript file with your own. It's easy. Sign up for a MAPBOX account at mapbox.com. You can get an access token for free just by signing up. This will allow you to create a map.

# CODE EDITOR
You can use any code editor. I prefer Visual Studio Code. 

There are two main ways to download files from a GitHub repository into Visual Studio Code:

Clone the repository: You can clone the repository using the Git version control system. To do this, open Visual Studio Code and click on the Source Control icon in the left-side menu. Then, click on the Clone Repository option and enter the URL of the repository you want to clone. Once the repository is cloned, you can navigate the files and make changes as needed.

Download the repository as a zip file: If you don't want to use Git, you can download the repository as a zip file and then extract its contents into a local directory. To do this, go to the GitHub repository page and click the "Clone or download" button, then select the "Download ZIP" option. After the download is complete, extract the contents of the zip file into a directory of your choice, and then open that directory in Visual Studio Code.
Once you've downloaded the repository files, you can use Visual Studio Code's built-in tools for editing, debugging, and testing your code.
